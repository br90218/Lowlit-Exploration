<p>
<time/>000.000|We were once prosperous, the tribe of all tribes<br>leaders of our kind.
<time/>009.898|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Az' tamare, or the floor of the Gods,<br>provided us with land of rich soil.
<time/>007.377|Crops never died and we would reap more than we needed.
<time/>014.322|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|While the women worked in the crops and the children<br>helped, the men guarded the village.
<time/>007.632|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|In our religion there are two Gods, rulers of paradise<br>and the lands of suffering, respectfully.
<time/>010.236|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Tamak, the God of life, is the keeper of what you know<br>as heaven.
<time/>006.150|And the other, who we do not speak of his name,<br>is the ruler of the firing abyss.
<time/>015.627|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|We also believed in the prophecy of Vja, which foresaw<br>the birth of a pair of twins.
<time/>007.244|However, Vja only predicted one of the twins to be the<br>bringer of hell.
<time/>013.304|For this reason, an old law has been strictly followed:<br>Every pair of twins born must be sent off to die.
<time/>025.034|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|As the father of a pair of newborn twins, Kay begged<br>the grand leader, Monakk, to spare their lives.
<time/>009.679|Monakk believed in the balance of fate; if a devil is to come,<br>then an angel will arrive as well.
<time/>018.020|In the end Monakk agreed to let them live, but they had<br>to be separated and taken care by two families.
<time/>028.748|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|The twins were treated differently. Etahk always enjoyed<br>laughing at people he had tricked. And for that the
<time/>008.347|community believed that he was the messenger of the devil.
<time/>014.612|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|On the other hand, Etwik, was a boy with a gentle heart,<br>passionate of nature, the world and life itself.
<time/>010.863|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Then came a time when hunting trips didn't bring the tribe<br>enough food. People were sick and starving.
<time/>008.766|Among the clueless hunters, Etahk came up with a bunch of<br>brilliant ideas. His tricks and plans eventually resolved
<time/>017.811|the village's malnutrition problem.
<time/>022.375|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Soon, Etahk grew popular among the villagers, but not Etwik.<br>Etwik was lonely, and he thought
<time/>009.053|That he too, should do something for the tribe.
<time/>015.035|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Not long after, Monakk died of illness.<br>While the villagers were saddened by the passing of our leader,
<time/>008.770|Etwik came up with a plan that he thought would make everyone proud.
<time/>016.000|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|On a night, he sneaked pass the guards to the holy grave,<br>and casted a spell on Monakk's body.
<time/>008.492|He thought he could bring Monakk back from the afterworld.
<time/>015.496|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Monakk did came back; but only his body, not the mind.<br>And along with his body came dark creatures from the shadows.
<time/>011.232|While the able-bodied defended the clan from these foul creatures,<br>we prayed for Tamak to come and return them
<time/>019.429|to where they belong.
<time/>023.124|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|But Tamak did not come.<br>Soon the village was raided. Most of us were killed or feasted upon;
<time/>010.031|Others were turned into one of them as well.
<time/>014.833|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Now it's only me at the altar. I'm leaving trails<br>to ensure that one day our story will be passed on,
<time/>008.565|and that one day balance will be brought back to this land.
<time/>016.239|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Only those who share the same blood as the twins can see these trails,<br>and fate, at last, has brought you here.
<time/>011.188|</off>
</p>
<p>
<time/>000.000|Now the land is shaded with darkness,<br>and you, are the only one who can bring it back to light.
<time/>009.645|So become who you are meant to be, my child. Become a legend.
<time/>015.507|</off>
