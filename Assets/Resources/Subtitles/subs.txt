We were once prosperous, the tribe of all tribes,
leaders of our kind.
>
Az' tamare, or the floor of the Gods,
provided us with land of rich soil.
-
Crops never died and we would reap more than we needed.
>
While the women worked in the crops and the children
helped, the men guarded the village.
>
In our religion there are two Gods, rulers of paradise
and the lands of suffering, respectfully.
>
Tamak, the God of life, is the keeper of what you know
as heaven.
-
And the other, who we do not speak of his name,
is the ruler of the firing abyss.
>
We also believed in the prophecy of Vja, which foresaw
the birth of a pair of twins.
-
Vja only predicted one of the twins to be the bringer
of hell.
>
For this reason, an old law has been strictly followed:
Every pair of twins born must be sent off to die.
>
As the father of a pair of newborn twins, he begged
the grand leader, Monakk, to spare their lives.
-
Monakk believed in the balance of fate; if a devil is
to come, then an angel will be granted as well.
-
In the end Monakk agreed to let them live, but they had
to be separated and taken care by two families.
>
The twins were treated differently. Etahk always enjoyed
laughing at people he had tricked. And for that the
-
community believed that he was the messenger of the devil.
>
On the other hand, Etwik, was a boy with a gentle heart,
passionate of nature, the world and life itself.
>
Then came a time when hunting trips didn't bring the tribe
enough food. People were sick and starving.
-
Among the clueless hunters, Etahk came up with brilliant
ideas. His tricks and plans eventually resolved
-
the village's malnutrition problem.
>
Soon Etahk grew popular among the villagers, but not
Etwik. Etwik was lonely, and he thought to himself that
-
he should do something for the tribe.
>
Not long after, Monakk died of illness. While the villagers
were saddened by the passing of our leader, Etwik came
-
up with a plan that he thought would make everyone proud.
>
On a night he sneaked pass the guards to the holy grave,
and casted a spell on Monakk's body.
-
He thought he could bring Monakk back from the afterworld.
>
Monakk did came back, but only his body, not the mind.
And along with his body came dark creatures from the shadows.
-
While the able bodied defended the clan from these foul
creatures, we prayed for Tamak to come and return them
to the darkness.
>
But Tamak did not come. Soon the village was raided. Most
of us were killed and feasted upon.
-
Others were turned into one of them as well.
>
Now it's only me at the altar. I'm leaving trails to
ensure that one day our story will be passed on,
-
and that one day balance will be brought back to this land.
>
Only those who share the same blood as the twins can see
these trails, and fate at last has brought you here.
-
Now the land is shaded with darkness, and you're the only
one who can bring it back to light.
>
So become who you're meant to be, my child. Become a legend.
