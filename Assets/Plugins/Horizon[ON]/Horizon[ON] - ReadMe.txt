Thanks for your purchase of Horizon[ON].

The included example scene is set up for gamma color space, please set the color space to gamma in the player settings. You can easily adjust Horizon[ON] for linear color space by changing the "Global Tint" in the main Settings of the Horizon Master. Please refer to the manual.

Before you contact me or ask for help in the forum, please read the manual, it has a "frequently asked questions" section and a troubleshooting section as well as an explanation for every element of Horizon[ON]. Also it contains a step by step getting started guide. I don't want to discourage you from posting in the forum, i only want to point out that most questions are answered in the manual. If you still have problems please do not hesitate to post in the forum!!! Also feedback is very welcome! If you made yourself familiar with Horizon[ON] i would appreciate an assetstore rating/review. Thank you :)

To make it possible to update the manual quickly without having to resubmit Horizon[ON] to the Unity Assetstore i provide the documentation as a download from Dropbox instead of including it in the package itself.

Please visit the forum thread to get the latest version of the manual(you can find it in the first post).
