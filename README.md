# The Low-lit Exploration Project
Welcome to the repository of the "Low-lit exploration project". You might find this repository to be a bit too clean from commits and merges: that's because I uploaded this entire project folder only after I'm done with my final build.

A few notes on this project:
* This is only a school project that I only had three weeks to work on

   So you might run into some, or maybe a lot of, bugs. So far I have not walked into an invisible hole in the ground, but if you unfortunately find yourself in the voids of negative-Z space please file an issue post.
   
* Minimum / Recommended computer specs not yet tested.

   The runnable was tested on a i7-4790K 4.40GHz, GTX 970, 16GB DDR3 RAM machine under 4K resolution, and generally I can still hold up my framerate at around 30 ~ 40 FPS. If you are experiencing some performance issues, please also file an issue post above, thanks!
   
* Again, this is only a school project that I didn't had enough time to work on

   So please let me know if there's any suggests on how to make this demo better!
   
## The story
You play as a girl who finds herself wandering into a small forest. She didn't know if it was by accident, though: she felt that something, some kind of voice is calling out to her. Your objective is to find out the truth behind the voice, and reveal the story behind these woods.

## How to play
This game supports both keyboard and joystick controls:
### Keyboard
* __W, A, S, D__ to move forward, left, backwards and right.
* Use __mouse__ to control camera view.
* Press __F__ to interact with items whenever the "Interact" icon appears.

### Joystick
* __IMPORTANT: I've only tested XBOX controllers. For PS4 controller users you might experience janky controls.__
* Use the __left thumbstick__ to move your character.
* Use the __right thumbstick__ to look around.
* Press __A__ to interact with itesm whenever the "Interact" icon appears.

## About the game itself:
* All assets are from the asset store, with the exception of the following items:
  * Scripts / code that are placed under the Assets/Scripts folder
  * The story
  * The game title sprite
  * The narrative audio clips
  * The symbol sprites
* The assets from the asset store belong to their respective creators.
* This game is only for fair, educational purposes only. I have absolutely no intent to to financially profit from this product.

## Last but not least
* Thanks to these people, without you this project would never be made possible:
  * Rainbow Tsai, who selflessly gave up a big part of her own time working on the recording of the audio narrative clips.
  * Ben Scott, who was willing to listen to my weirdest problems with Unity, and gave me a lot of advice on optimization.
  * All people who gave me great suggestions and feedback along the way!
  
## Alright, finally:
* I have a [blog](https://br90218.tumblr.com) that keeps record of all the developing process. Head over there if you want to learn more about beind the scenes! (pun intended)
* I also have a [personal portfolio website](https://br90218.github.io), where I put most of me and my projects there. Go on and play!
